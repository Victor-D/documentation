Codership is pleased to announce a new GA release of Galera Cluster for
MySQL 5.7, consisting of MySQL-wsrep 5.7.18 and Galera 3.21, wsrep API
version 25.

This release incorporates all changes up to MySQL 5.7.18.

Galera Cluster 5.7 is now available as targeted packages and package
repositories for Debian, Ubuntu and CentOS. Obtaining packages using a
package repository removes the need to download individual files and
facilitates the deployment and upgrade of Galera nodes.

This and future releases will be available from http://www.galeracluster.com.

Notable bug fixes in MySQL-wsrep:

* Fix for thread leak when changing the value of wsrep_slave_threads
  (MW-336)

* The issue of DROP TABLE containing temporary tables resulting in binlog
  divergence has been fixed (MW-360)

* RESET MASTER is now rejected if the wsrep provider is enabled (MW-362)

* InnoDB buffer pool is not dumped anymore at server shutdown when
  --wsrep-recover option is given (MW-365)

* Improved IPv6 support (MW-366)

* Fixes for certfication key generation in the presence of foreign key
  constraints (MW-369)

* Fix to debug assertion MW-379

* SHOW STATUS will not block anymore with wsrep_sync_wait=1 (MW-86)


Known issues with this release:

* SST between 5.6 and 5.7 nodes is not supported;

* The --wsrep-replication-bundle option has no effect and may be removed in
  a future release

* InnoDB tablespaces outside of the data directory are not supported, as they
  may not be copied over during SST

* Compilation with DTrace enabled may fail, so -DENABLE_DTRACE=0 may be used
  to disable DTrace
