Codership is pleased to announce a new release of Galera Cluster for MySQL
consisting of MySQL-wsrep 5.6.36 and Galera 3.21, wsrep API version 25.

This release incorporates all changes up to MySQL 5.6.36.

Galera Cluster is now available as targeted packages and package repositories
for a number of Linux distributions, including Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS,
RHEL, OpenSUSE, SLES and FreeBSD. Obtaining packages using a package repository
removes the need to download individual files and facilitates the deployment and
upgrade of Galera nodes.

This and future releases will be available from http://www.galeracluster.com.
The source repositories and bug tracking are now on http://www.github.com/codership .

Notable bug fixes in MySQL-wsrep:

* CREATE TABLE AS SELECT fixes (MW-317, MW-322)

* Fix for thread leak when changing the value of wsrep_slave_threads
  (MW-336)

* The issue of DROP TABLE containing temporary tables resulting in binlog
  divergence has been fixed (MW-360)

* RESET MASTER is now rejected if the wsrep provider is enabled (MW-362)

* InnoDB buffer pool is not dumped anymore at server shutdown when
  --wsrep-recover option is given (MW-365)

* Improved IPv6 support (MW-366)

* Fixes for certfication key generation in the presence of foreign key
  constraints (MW-369)

* SHOW STATUS will not block anymore with wsrep_sync_wait=1 (MW-86)


Known issues with this release:

* If using the Ubuntu 16.04 Xenial package, the server can not be bootstrapped
  using systemd. Please use the SysV init script with the 'bootstap' option to
  bootstrap the node. Note that a server that has been started that way can not
  be controlled via systemd and must be stopped using the SysV script. Normal
  server startup and shutdown is possible via systemd.
